# Libre Computer Raspbian Portability
## Objective
This script is designed to run on existing Raspbian images and enables them
to boot on any Libre Computer board. It uses an upstream FOSS software stack
developed by the community and Libre Computer to support booting Raspbian.

It is a proof-of-concept and there are no warranties implied or otherwise.
We highly recommend backing up the image if it holds important data in case
something unexpected occurs. While the image should still boot on the original
device, this is not fully tested or guaranteed so continue at your own risk.

This script installs/configures/overwrites data on the device's MicroSD card.
It is designed to run on Raspberry Pi&reg;s and requires internet access to 
download additional necessary components. Once the script finishes, the card
should still remain bootable on the original board.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or higher
- Reliable MicroSD Card (Samsung/SanDisk recommended)
- MicroUSB Power Supply
- Internet Connection
- [Any Libre Computer board (Amazon Link)](https://amzn.to/3c2xvAS)

## Supported Distributions
- [Raspbian 10 Buster Lite and Desktop armhf](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-legacy)
- [Raspbian 11 Bullseye Lite and Desktop armhf](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)
- [Raspbian 11 Bullseye Lite and Desktop arm64](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-64-bit)
- NOOBS (New Out Of Box Software) installations are not supported.
- If you want to use Ubuntu, you can use these [Ubuntu 22.04 images](https://hub.libre.computer/t/ubuntu-22-04-1-jammy-lts-for-libre-computer-boards/20).
- If you want to use Raspbian, you can use these [Raspbian 11 images](https://hub.libre.computer/t/raspbian-11-bullseye-for-libre-computer-boards/82).

## Supported Features
- GPIOs and Device Tree Overlays (dtoverlay) for I2C, SPI, UART, PWM need to be mapped via [libretech-wiring-tool](https://github.com/libre-computer-project/libretech-wiring-tool.git).
- Software designed around specific Raspberry Pi&reg; hardware such as MIPI cameras, DPI displays, DSI pannels are not supported.

## How to Use
[YouTube Video RunThrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK9hq4qYVeE)
On your Raspberry Pi:registered:, run:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/wardell64/libretech-raspbian-portability.git lrp
sudo lrp/oneshot.sh aml-s905x-cc
```
Replace aml-s905x-cc with the appropriate board you want the image to run on and follow the instructions.
For a list of boards, run sudo lrp/oneshot.sh

## Roadmap
- Refactor to robust coding standards
- Device tree overlay translation via our [wiring tool](https://github.com/libre-computer-project/libretech-wiring-tool.git)
- Firmware for specific boards

We provide commercial support for porting specific distros or images, [please reach out to us](https://libre.computer/#contact).
